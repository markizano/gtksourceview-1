CVS guidelines for gtksourceview
================================

Please don't commit directly to the CVS unless you have been
given the green light to commit freely to gtksourceview.  
When in doubt assume you haven't ;-). 

Please send patches to gustavo.giraldez@gmx.net and paolo.maggi@polito.it.
Eventually cc to the gtksourceview mailing list.
We will review them with much pleasure.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  

We really appreciate your help, we just want to review these fixes 
before applying.

If you are a "build sheriff", feel free to commit fixes for build and 
configure (please, send us an e-mail with the patch you have applied).

Thanks,
Gustavo and Paolo
