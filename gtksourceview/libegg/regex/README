Below is the original EggRegex README file. This directory (in gtksourceview
distribution) contains eggregex branch developed by Marco Barisione,
checked out on July 23, 2006.

=======================================================================

This directory contains regular expression api which should eventually
land in GLib. We have put it here, since it didn't get enough testing
to put it into GLib 2.6.

TODO items:
- Improve the Unicode support by making PCRE use the GLib Unicode functions.
- Maybe change the replace functions to replace only one match.
